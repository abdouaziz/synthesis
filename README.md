# Tacotron : Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis
This is a PyTorch implementation of [Natural TTS Synthesis by Conditioning WaveNet on Mel Spectrogram Predictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf) (also known as Tacotron-1).

In this replemntation version we use Scaled Dot-Product Attention instead of Location-Sensitive Attention.
